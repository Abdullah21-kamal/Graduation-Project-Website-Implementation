# Graduation-Project-Website-Implementation
this is the implementation code of the frontend and backend of my graduation project in which I was responsible for implementing the website that represent out AI system as a final product besides by role in the AI model itself
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design the frontend task and the website interface 
To implement an interactive website with the AI models, I used FASTAPI in python to implement the backend task that connect the models, the user interactions and the AI models
# You can see the website interface and the output of the models through "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h5PHDA4IYGCVndLWrl_JewdLXxW6mwjW?usp=sharing"
The ultimate goal of this project is to revolutionize the world of football refereeing by eliminating human errors and enhancing the accuracy of decision-making. With the application of advanced Deep Learning models, we aim to empower referees and create a fairer playing field. ü§ñ‚öΩÔ∏è
Our project encompasses three crucial tasks, each contributing to the overall functionality of the AI Football Referee system:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Action Recognition: Through the power of Deep Learning, we have developed models capable of accurately identifying various player actions during a football match. Whether it's a foul, a goal, or an offside, our AI system can identify and classify these actions swiftly and reliably.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ball & Player Detection and Tracking: Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, our system can detect and track the ball's position as well as players on the field. This functionality is crucial in providing referees with additional insights and data for making accurate decisions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Bird's Eye View: Our AI system can generate a comprehensive bird's eye view of the football field, offering an invaluable perspective to referees. This top-down view enhances their understanding of player positioning, movement patterns, and tactical strategies, leading to better decision-making.
As of now, our Deep Learning models have reached a significant milestone, serving as a supportive tool for referees to make informed decisions during matches. While the system is currently not public, we have designed a user-friendly website to display the output of our models, enabling referees to access valuable information in real-time.
I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made during this project and the potential it holds for transforming the world of football refereeing. üåç‚öΩÔ∏è
Our project achieved the 6th place in the SoccerNet competition and we will be mentioned in its paper as authors.
